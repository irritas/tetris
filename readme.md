The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. This is done in two main ways: completing lines and manually dropping blocks. Completing multiple lines at once multiplies the points awarded. In addition, the level is advanced when a quota of lines is completed. Each new level the tetrominoes drop faster but are worth more points.

One useful tool available to the player is the save button. By pressing it, the next block is instead saved for later use, and can be swapped with the current next block at any time.

_Controls:_
